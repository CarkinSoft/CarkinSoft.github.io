<h1>Game Development</h1>

<p>
    Game Development is a field of computer science that deals with the designand development of video games.
    Making games requires people of all disciplines, from artists to programmers but some people make games entirely alone as well.
    Minecraft for example was originally made by one person. His company eventually grew and that was when he brought
    more people on board to help him improve the game.
