<h1>Strad From Minecraft</h1>
<p>This is a song from Minecraft.
    The song is called Strad and heavily uses synthetic instruments aka "SYNTH".
    Synth is a type of sound that is made using computer code and there are many different types of synths and ways to "make noises"
    from code. There is a huge variety of careers where people create audio mixing software, synthesizers, and more.

    Side note:
    Minecraft is a game that was made using Java!
    Java was actually the first coding language I
    ever learned.
    While its syntax is very different from C++,
    in practice the two languages are very similar.
